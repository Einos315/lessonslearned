When it comes to creating a website, there are key digital tools and infrastructure that are important to keep in mind.

First, it is important to understand the differences between front end and back end tools. Front end tools support what you see on the page -- style, links, etc. Back end tools support the server side of the website, a database, or even an application.

Front end languages include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- HTML, or hypertext markeup language, is the core language of web development. It is used to label the content of a web page.
- CSS, or cascading style sheets, are used to enhance the visual style of a website.
- JavaScript enables a web developer to create interactive, animated imagery and tools on a website.

Backend languages include Ruby, Python, and PHP. Frameworks typically make the languages easier to use. 

There are also text editors that can be used for writing HTML that make things easier (autopopulates tags, etc.). Sublime and atom are two of these.
