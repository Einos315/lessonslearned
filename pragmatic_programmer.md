# Lessons from Pragmatic Programmer

## Keys to being a good coder:
* Orthagonality - each function should be independent of the others
* Understand tools - wizards and how they work
* Curiosity - desire to learn
* T-shaped knowledge - broad knowledge across the board and expertise in few things

## Keys to Spec software development:
* Code should not be perfect - aim for "good enough"
* Launch quickly and iterate constantly
* Build to be flexible
* DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself

## Keys to Managing Software Development:
* No broken window
* Knowledge in plain text
* Test your software for bugs frequently and once you identify one create automatic tests to check for them in the future. 
* Monolinarity
* Find ways to inspire/engage your team members - knowledge workers are incentivized not just through monetary compensation
